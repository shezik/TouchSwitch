# TouchSwitch
 A widget for Windows that enables and disables devices, primarily touch screens.

This is an effort to make my spending on a tablet seems worthwhile, which in turn saves my soul.

One use case of this widget is that if like me, you bought an ARM64 Windows tablet with a decent oomph however downright shitty touch screen and digitizer (yes you got it right, it is Xiaomi Book 12.4 Inch. Xiaomi again. \*sigh\*), before you try to let the stylus reach the screen before your hand does but still fail miserably due to the exceptionally short detection range and unproportionally long latency of the digitizer which of course renders the palm rejection feature pratically useless, you could touch this widget to disable the touch screen, write on it with the stylus, then poke the widget with the stylus till it turns green again to re-enable the touch screen.

This is literally code shitposting. I mean who tf uses MFC in 2025?

It's not like I'm familiar with it or what, I learned everything on the go. (albeit to a limited extent)

The sole reason I chose to use MFC is that it's fast and small in size. (that's what ur mom said)

Which is also intrinsic to C++ programs. (apparently when you apply this criteria, Qt is no longer written in C++.)
